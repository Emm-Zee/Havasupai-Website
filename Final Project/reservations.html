    If you plan to visit Havasupai Falls, you must <a href="https://www.havasupaireservations.com/">secure a pass</a> in advance. Passes are difficult to secure and 
    only available for a 4 day/3 night stay. You don’t have to stay the entire time, but this is the only type of 
    pass that is available. The tribe opens up all reservations for the upcoming year in February. They typically 
    sell out very quickly (within an hour or two), though if you check back you might be able to secure tickets at a later 
    date if a pass holder sells their tickets.

    <br>
    When I visited, I read on the website when we bought our tickets that they were non-refundable and non-exchangable, 
    though we talked to other backpackers during our trip who had purchased their tickets only a couple of weeks before. 
    Since tickets sell out so quickly, the only time we were able to visit for the upcoming year was at the beginning of 
    February. After booking our tickets, we said to ourselves, “are we crazy for backpacking in the middle of winter?” 
    Turns out, it was a wise choice! Not as many people visit during the winter, so if you want a more peaceful, 
    isolated experience, then winter is the time to go. You also don’t have to worry about extreme heat and dehydration like 
    you do during the summer. Keep in mind that if you want to explore beyond Mooney Falls and go to Beaver Falls as well as the Colorado River,
    you have to trek through water, which won't be as refreshing as it is during the summer. We did not get in during our visit because we were afraid
    of hypothermia, though other brave visiters did venture to Beaver Falls.
